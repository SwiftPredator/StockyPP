## Explorativ Stock Price Prediction using wavelet transformation and LSTM with attention

This notebook shows how one can utilize wavelet transformation and a LSTM Model with attention mechanism to predict if a stock price goes up or down.
I reformulated the problem of stock prediction to a binary classification problem, since its really hard to forecast the actual stock price.

At the moment this is more of a weekend project, so please feel free to contact me or make a pull request if you think i made a mistake in some part of the process. Im always open to improve mistakes.
